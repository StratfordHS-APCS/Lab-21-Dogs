# Lab 21 - Dog

**Lab Goal:**   
This lab was designed to give you practice using inheritance.

**Lab Description:**   
You have been provided a working Dog class.  Create subclasses for 2 different types of dogs (you may choose which types).  Each type of dog should include:

   - An instance variable for the dog's weight
   - A default constructor
   - A constructor that sets the weight and name (you should not have an instance variable for name in the subclass).
   - A `toString` method.
   - A method overriding the `speak` method in `Dog`.

Test what you have created in `Main.main`.
